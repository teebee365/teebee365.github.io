    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>Hey!
        I am a second year student currently studying Media and Culture. I love being able to add elements of my experience as a young black women into my work. I particularly enjoyed writing about the Afro Comb as a cultural object.
    </p> 
    
    
    
    <p>I am a mother and I take pride in parenting. My son is 3 years old and enjoys gardening, playing in the mud kitchen and making music. I have started writing a childrens book with characters that look like my son because I think reperesentation is important.This book will hopefully be the start of a whole collection.  
    </p>
